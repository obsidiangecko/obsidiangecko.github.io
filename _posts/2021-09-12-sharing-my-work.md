title: "Sharing What I'm Working On"

In an effort to develop my programming and data handling skils, I've been working on a couple of little projects. 
Finding it difficult to decide where to start, I've been working on multiple projects simultaneously.
This might seem foolhardy, but I've convinced myself that it will help maintain motivation, as I can switch
projects when I get bogged down and let my brain sort out the tricky details while I'm working on something else.
No, I haven't considered what happens when I get bogged down in multiple projects simultaneously - probably take up
learning Korean again.
I'm looking forward to having the opportunity to share what I'm doing.
