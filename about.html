	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>I'm Heather Cox, and I count data nerd amongst my array of quirks. I'm not too shabby
  with a Rubik's Cube, and I'm a big Formula 1 fan (have you seen the data!?). I enjoy programming, working with electronics
  and just generally solving problems, but I REALLY like data, and performing neat tricks with it.
  </p>
  <p>I'm venturing onto GitHub to share some of the projects I'm working on, practice some of
  the skills I've learned during my degree, and hopefully contribute to some open source projects.
